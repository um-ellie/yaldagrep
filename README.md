# Yalda Grep Tool

### In memory of Yalda Aghafazli, an Iranian freedom fighter.

## Description
Yalda Grep Tool is a simple command-line tool written in Rust that performs grep-like functionality. It allows you to search for a specific query within a given file.

**Note from the Developer:**
As I am an aspiring programmer and continuously learning, feedback and suggestions are highly valued to improve this project.

## Features
- Search for a query within a file
- Case-sensitive and case-insensitive search options
- Command-line interface for easy usage
- Rust implementation for performance and reliability

## Usage
To use Yalda Grep Tools, simply run the executable and provide the query and file path as command-line arguments.

$ ./ygrep <query> <file_path>


### Options
- `<query>`: The string you want to search for within the file.
- `<file_path>`: The path to the file in which you want to search.

### Example

$ ./ygrep "search" <file_name>


## Installation
To install Yalda Grep Tools, you need to compile the Rust source code into an executable. Make sure you have Rust installed on your system, then navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

$ cd yaldagrep
$ cargo build --release


This will create an executable file named `ygrep` in the `target/release` directory.
